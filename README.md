# VLE-McCabe-Thiele-model-python-simulation
The model utilizes CSV files as input to plot the VLE. The parameters include Murphree efficiency, bottom, feed, and distillate compositions, as well as the R factor. The output is a McCabe-Thiele plot, which allows you to determine the number of stages and the molar composition at each stage.

## How to Use 
Download to McCabe-Thiele.ipynb file. Open it in vscode. Run with python 3.12.0 kernel.
